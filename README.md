- We exchanged contact information (phone no.) and determined the communication platforms, creating a WhatsApp group and respective Trello accounts.
- We decided to meet twice a week, once in the weekend and once on Tuesdays. This meeting plan may be subject to change based on our timetables.

- We assigned Arbli Troshani as our Team Leader.
- We assigned team roles as follows:
  - Enxhi was assigned as editor to write meeting reports.
  - Gerd was assigned as repo master to help everyone establish git repositories and researcher.
  - Egi was assigned as customer representative.
- In order to facilitate our ideas in an efficient manner, we set the guidelines for our project as follows.
  - Our team name is : EgeaSoft
  - The aim of our work is to develop solutions for a mid or large scale problems in an efficient and innovative manner.
  - Our aim as a team, is to provide the best possible solution to the problems being considered and implement features to provide functionalities which are easy to grasp and use. Thus, our working approach will be strongly based on Teamwork, Innovation and practicality.

  - Conflict Resolution:
    - Issues will be discussed in order to reach at a compromise
    - In case of no compromise, the situation will be evaluated beforehand from the team leader
    - In case of an aggravated situation with no apparent solutions at hand, voting will take place considering solutions proposed by each member. To settle the issue, the leader&#39;s vote counts as two, as compared to another member&#39;s vote which counts as one. This makes sure that an even result 2-2 is not possible.

- Each team member came up with several ideas such as :
  - Arbli: Repair for me
    - A portal where users find solutions to their household/workplace repair issues by creating issues and awaiting professionals to responds. This portal would be designed with the professionals&#39; careers in mind.
  - Gerd: Payroll Management System
    - An easy to use management system suited to the workplace in both public and private institutions. This system would aim at monitoring and validating the work done by employees on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. The system would also facilitate the submission of work reports, bonuses, absence leaves etc.
  - Enxhi: Dentistry Management System ( This is the Current Choice)
    - A mobile-based application to manage the entire process of work that takes place in a Dental Clinic, starting from the management of Visits &amp; Treatments, to the management of the logistics.
  - Egi: Workspace Management System.
    - A system suited to the academic process, by which every student would be able to manage their workspace based on their interests, courses and assignments. This system would provide students with the choice of managing their personal space and group/classroom spaces.
